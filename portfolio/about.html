                        Hello there! I am currently a 3rd-year student at Sri Krishna College of Technology, passionate about web development. 
                        My educational journey began at Ravilla KRA Vidhyashram Matriculation Higher Secondary School, 
                        where I laid the foundation for my academic pursuits.
                        Web development has captivated my interest, and I'm dedicated to honing my skills in this domain. 
                        My academic endeavors have resulted in a CGPA of 8.04, a testament to my commitment to learning and growth.
